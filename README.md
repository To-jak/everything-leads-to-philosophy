# everything-leads-to-philosophy
React Web application that highlights a surprising fact: almost every wikipedia article leads to the philosophy wiki page.

> Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, would usually lead to the Philosophy article. As of February 2016, 97% of all articles in Wikipedia eventually led to the article Philosophy.
